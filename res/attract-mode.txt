# List of candidates for self-running 'captive' demos
#
# Not all games are good candidates. Some have no demo mode at all.
# Others technically have one but it's visually uninteresting or too short.
# Others are ruled out by technical constraints. Due to the architecture of
# the launcher, all captive demos must run entirely in main memory (48K).
# NO languard card, NO auxmem!
#
# We have enough disk space that we don't worry too much about it. (Wow.)
# Generally we start with an uncompressed ProDOS port of the entire game
# and whittle it down to just the files it needs for its demo mode, then
# apply patches so that it
#
# - returns control after the natural end of the demo cycle
# - returns control on any keypress
# - returns control on any button press (note: some games don't support
#   joystick buttons at all, and we don't add button support, but if you
#   can start the game by pressing a button, we need to ensure that that
#   returns control instead)
# - disables all sound output
#
# 'Returning control' involves activating RAM bank 1 read access and
# jumping to $D000 (labeled as |Reenter| in the source code). The launcher
# puts this code at $0100 before executing a captive demo, so generally
# you can just put 'JMP $0100' anywhere. If a particular game overwrites
# this area of the stack page, you will need to find 6 bytes for the
# 'LDA $C088 / JMP $D000' instructions yourself.
